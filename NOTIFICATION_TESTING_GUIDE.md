# Notification Testing Guide

This guide shows you how to test all the new notifications in your debt management app.

## üéØ New Notifications Added

1. **Backup Success** - "Daily backup completed successfully"
2. **App Update Available** - "New version with improved features available"
3. **Auto-Reminder Sent** - "Payment reminder sent to X customers"
4. **Auto-Backup** - "Automatic backup completed at 12:00 AM"

## üß™ How to Test Notifications

### Method 1: Manual Testing (Recommended)

1. **Open the app** and navigate to **Settings**
2. **Tap on "Notification Settings"**
3. **Scroll down** to the "Test New Notifications" section
4. **Tap each test button** to trigger the notifications:
   - "Test Backup Success"
   - "Test App Update Available"
   - "Test Auto-Reminder Sent (5 customers)"
   - "Test Auto-Backup (12:00 AM)"

### Method 2: Automatic Testing

#### Backup Success Notification
- **When it triggers:** When daily automatic backup completes
- **How to test:** Wait for the scheduled backup or manually trigger a backup
- **Location:** Background backup service automatically calls this

#### Auto-Backup Notification
- **When it triggers:** When scheduled automatic backup completes at 12:00 AM
- **How to test:** Wait for midnight backup or manually trigger background backup
- **Location:** Background app refresh service calls this

#### Auto-Reminder Sent Notification
- **When it triggers:** When you send batch payment reminders
- **How to test:** 
  1. Go to "Payment Reminders" screen
  2. Select customers with outstanding debts
  3. Tap "Send Reminders"
  4. Notification will show how many customers were notified

#### App Update Available Notification
- **When it triggers:** When app checks for updates (currently set to return false)
- **How to test:** 
  1. Use the test button in Notification Settings
  2. Or modify `app_update_service.dart` to return `true` in `_checkForUpdateAvailable()`

## üîß Testing Different Scenarios

### Test with Different Customer Counts
```dart
// In notification settings, you can test with different numbers:
await _notificationService.showAutoReminderSentNotification(1);  // 1 customer
await _notificationService.showAutoReminderSentNotification(10); // 10 customers
await _notificationService.showAutoReminderSentNotification(0);  // 0 customers
```

### Test with Different Times
```dart
// Test different backup times:
await _notificationService.showAutoBackupNotification('12:00 PM');
await _notificationService.showAutoBackupNotification('6:30 AM');
await _notificationService.showAutoBackupNotification('11:59 PM');
```

## üì± iOS Notification Settings

Make sure your iOS device allows notifications:

1. **Open iOS Settings**
2. **Go to Notifications**
3. **Find "Bechaalany Connect"**
4. **Enable notifications** and choose your preferred style
5. **Set interruption level** (Active, Time Sensitive, Critical, or Passive)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If notifications don't appear:

1. **Check iOS notification permissions**
2. **Verify the app is not in Do Not Disturb mode**
3. **Check if notifications are enabled in app settings**
4. **Try restarting the app**

### If test buttons don't work:

1. **Check console for errors**
2. **Verify notification service is initialized**
3. **Make sure you're testing on a physical device (not simulator)**

## üîÑ Automatic Triggers

### Backup Notifications
- **Daily Backup:** Triggers when `BackgroundBackupService` completes backup
- **Auto-Backup:** Triggers when `BackgroundAppRefreshService` completes backup

### Reminder Notifications
- **Auto-Reminder:** Triggers when batch payment reminders are sent from Payment Reminders screen

### Update Notifications
- **App Update:** Triggers when app starts and checks for updates (currently disabled for testing)

## üìä Notification Types

All notifications follow iOS 18.6+ standards:
- **Success notifications** (Green) - For successful operations
- **Info notifications** (Blue) - For informational messages
- **Error notifications** (Red) - For failed operations (not added in this update)

## üé® Customization

You can customize notification messages by editing the methods in `notification_service.dart`:

```dart
// Example: Customize backup success message
Future<void> showDailyBackupSuccessNotification() async {
  await showSuccessNotification(
    title: 'Backup Success',
    body: 'Your data has been safely backed up to the cloud', // Custom message
    payload: 'daily_backup_success',
  );
}
```
