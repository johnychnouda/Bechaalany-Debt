## ⚠️ What Likely Caused Rejection

Based on the screenshot you shared, Apple probably saw:

1. **Old screenshots** showing:
   - "Plans & pricing" section
   - Monthly Plan: $5.00 per month
   - Yearly Plan: $99.00 per year

2. **App description** mentioning subscriptions

3. **Outdated build** (before you removed pricing)

**Solution:** Update App Store Connect with current materials.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to change any code?**  
A: **No!** Your code (v1.1.1+3) is already compliant. Only update App Store Connect.

**Q: What if Apple rejects again?**  
A: Request a phone call with App Review. They can review the app live and see there are no payment flows.

**Q: Should I mention the business debt payments?**  
A: Yes! Clarify that "payments" refer to customer debt tracking (business operations), not app subscriptions.

**Q: What about the privacy policy?**  
A: I've created a complete privacy policy emphasizing the app is FREE and no payment data is collected. Upload `privacy-policy.html` to your website or hosting.

**Q: How do I take new screenshots?**  
A: Run your current app (v1.1.1+3), navigate to key screens, and take screenshots showing the FREE access model without pricing.
